## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Transaction JSON bodies no longer lose precision on u64/u128 values**
  ([#14](https://github.com/Entropy-Foundation/supra-ts-sdk/pull/14)). Bigint
  fields were coerced to `number` before serialization, so any value above
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` was rounded on its way to the RPC — a caller-supplied
  `9007199254740993` was emitted as `9007199254740992`. Because the signature is
  computed over the BCS encoding of the raw transaction, a rounded JSON body no
  longer matched what was signed: `submit` was rejected on signature
  verification, and `simulate` — which zeroes the signatures before sending —
  silently reported results for a transaction the caller never authored.

  Affected: script payload `U64`/`U128` arguments, the raw transaction header
  fields, and the automation registration u64 fields. Entry function arguments
  were never affected, since they travel as BCS bytes. The wire format is
  unchanged and no server-side change is required.

### Changed

- **Public type widening (source-compatibility note).** The u64 fields of the
  exported types `RawTxnJSON`, `ScriptArgumentJson` and
  `AutomationRegistrationParamV1JSON` are now `bigint | number` instead of
  `number`. No public API returns these types, so passing them as input or
  letting the SDK build them is unaffected. Only TypeScript code that annotates
  its own values with them and then reads a u64 field into a `number` needs a
  narrowing check or a `BigInt`/`Number` conversion.

### Security

- Patched the dev-only `js-yaml@3` transitive dependency, bumping the override
  from `^3.15.0` to `^3.15.2`
  ([#13](https://github.com/Entropy-Foundation/supra-ts-sdk/pull/13)). The
  pinned `3.15.0` is vulnerable to quadratic CPU consumption during `!!omap`
  resolution (GHSA 1138114, the unbackported CVE-2026-59870 fix). It is reached
  only through the Jest toolchain, so no published artifact was affected.

### Internal

- The HTTP `post` layer now serializes every request body through a new
  bigint-aware stringifier that writes bigints as exact JSON number literals and
  fails closed if a payload string collides with its internal marker.
- `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills` are now symlinks to `CLAUDE.md` and
  `.claude/skills` so the two copies cannot drift. The npm tarball is unchanged:
  `files` still ships `.claude/skills`, and the symlinks are not included.
- Added regression tests asserting the serialized request body for values above
  2^53, plus first-time coverage for `parseScriptArgs`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-21

Initial public release: typed account queries, the transaction lifecycle
(build → simulate → submit → wait), proxy-based ABI contract interaction, coin
and fungible asset helpers, event and block queries, and Move-native type
handling. Dual ESM/CJS output, Node 18+.
